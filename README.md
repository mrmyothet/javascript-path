### [Good Parts of JavaScript and the Web by Douglas Crockford](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/good-parts-javascript-web/table-of-contents)

##### Chapter 1 - Programming Style & Your Brain

- Right Curly Brace - works well in JavaScript
- A good style can help produce better programs
- Programs must communicate clearly to people
- Use elements of good composition where applicable
- Confusion must be avoided
- Always use ===, never ==
- If there is a feature of a language that is sometimes problematic, and if it can be replaced with another feature that is more reliable, then always use the more reliable feature.
- Make your programs look like what they do
- Declare all variables at the top of the function
- Declare all functions before you call them
- Constructor functions should be named with InitialCaps, nothing else should be named with InitialCaps
- JSLint defines a professional subset of JavaScript
- WARNING! JSLint will hurt your feelings
