### [Good Parts of JavaScript and the Web by Douglas Crockford](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/good-parts-javascript-web/table-of-contents)

##### Chapter 1 - Programming Style & Your Brain

- Right Curly Brace - works well in JavaScript
- A good style can help produce better programs
- Programs must communicate clearly to people
- Use elements of good composition where applicable
- Confusion must be avoided
- Always use ===, never ==
- If there is a feature of a language that is sometimes problematic, and if it can be replaced with another feature that is more reliable, then always use the more reliable feature.
- Make your programs look like what they do
- Declare all variables at the top of the function
- Declare all functions before you call them
- Constructor functions should be named with InitialCaps, nothing else should be named with InitialCaps
- JSLint defines a professional subset of JavaScript
- WARNING! JSLint will hurt your feelings

##### Chapter 2 - And Then There was JavaScriipt

- ECMAScript
  - 1999 - ES3
  - 2009 - ES5
  - 2015 - ES6
- Where do Bad Parts come from?
  - Legacy
  - Good Intentions
  - Haste
- Objects
  - An object is a dynamic collection of properties
  - [keys] must be strings - automatic type coercion
  - Object literals
  - Prototypal Inheritance
- Number
  - Decimal fractions are approximate
  - Numbers are first class objects
  - Math object
  - NaN - NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN
  - Number.MAX_VALUE
- Strings
  - Strings are immutable
  - Use " for external strngs
  - Use ' for internal strings and characters
  - Convert a string to a number
    - Use Number function
    - Use `+` prefix operator
    - ParseInt - The radix (10) should always be used
- Arrays
  - sort - will sort by alphabetical order
  - Arrays vs Objects
    - Use objects when the name are arbitrary
    - Use arrays when the names are sequential integers
- All values are objects - Except null and undefined
- undefined
  - The default value for variables and parameters
  - The value of missing members in objects and arrays
- Use `undefined` instead of `null`, because JS language use `undefined`
- Boolean
  - `Falsy` values
    - false
    - null
    - undefined
    - "" (empty string)
    - 0
    - NaN
  - All other values are `truthy`
  - All values can be said to be boolish
- `&&` - logical and - If first operand is `truthy` then result is second operand, else result is first operand
- `||` - logical or - If first operand is `truthy` then result is first operand, else result is second operand
- `!` - logical not - If the operand is truthy, result is false, otherwise result is true
- `!!` produces booleans
- `for` loop
  - Use `forEach` or `map` method instead
- `For in`
  - Use Object.keys instead
- `Switch` statements
  - The switch values does not need to a number. It can be a string.
  - The case values can be expressions
